# ggeom

This is an implementation of some 2D computational geometry algorithms in Go. Scalar values are represented as `big.Rat`s. By redefining the `Scalar` typedef in `ggeom.go`, you can use any other type which follows the same API.

The focus is on implementing the algorithms required to compute 2D offset polygons via [Ron Wein's algorithm](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b049/3b89b18d785ca81427404ec78d7ce6602ceb.pdf).

Algorithms implemented so far:

* The intersections of a sequence of connected line segments (via the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm).

* A test for whether or not a point lies inside (or on one of the line segments of) a 2D polygon.

* The intersection of two non-self-intersecting 2D polygons without holes (via the Weiler-Atherton algorithm).

* The elementary circuits of the convolution of one 2D polygon with another. (This is the computation at the heart of Wein's algorithm for computing offset polygons.)
